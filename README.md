Is democracy good for football? 
Democracy vs football, 1 : 0.3


Or is football just a wealthy nations sport? The  correlation between a country economic growth and athletic achievement is well known. But what about political system and football? Countries' democracy levels actually significantly correlate with their national football team performances. Along with a bunch of other factors. A tale of miscellaneous correlations with national football team ratings. 


National sport achievements in general are linked to economical developement. This was well studied regarding the [Olympics](http://assets.sportanddev.org.sad.vm.iway.ch/downloads/79__sport_in_developing_countries.pdf). 


But what about the relationship between a countryâ€™s economy, its reservoir of football players, its democractic levels and football performance? All these factors are packed in the graphic under.

There is statistically significant correlation between football ratings and democracy levels, i.e. more democratic nations tend to be better at football.

No causality is hereby seriously suggested though. After all, one can prove that the [per capita mozarella cheese consumption is correlated with the number of civil engineering doctorates awarded](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). However interestingly, a country's wealth (GDP per capita) or the number of fooball players in a country are unsurprisingly  significantly correlated with a nation football performances but to a lesser extent than democracy levels*. 


[[graphic]]

* Wealthy nations are the most democratic, nothing new here but it is particulary visible with all the dark bubbles on the right hand side of the graphic. Note however that [experts have not yet established a causality link between democracy and wealth](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/growth-0). An [alternative view](http://www.nber.org/papers/w4909) is that prosperity tends to inspire democracy rather than the other way around. 
* Among the national football teams that overperform given the authoritarian regime  let's mention the Ivory Coast and Iran (both with less 3.5 of democratic index)
* At the other end of the spectrum, Brazil, Colombia, Spain and Germany




Data and methods

* The democracy index 2015 is compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture.

* [ELO ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) was used instead of the official FIFA rating to assess national football team performance. Although both ratings currently do not largely differ, [it was found](http://lasek.rexamine.com/football_rankings.pdf) that the ELO rating is a much better measure of a football team performance than the official FIFA ranking.
